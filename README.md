# MathematicalPython
In this set of ipynb notebooks, I implement 5 classic mathematical algorithms using python libraries. The five algorithms are:
- numerical differentiation
- interpolation techniques
- discovering roots of polynomial equations
- ODE approximations via finite difference methods
- numerical integration of functions of one variables
